A sound understanding of this computational model makes programming in R much easier and more productive! This workshop series is intended for active engagement – be prepared to come to each session with questions about why some things worked, and others didn’t. All researchers (students, postdocs, faculty and staff) who meet the ‘prerequisites’ are welcome to register for this workshop series, which is being offered in person at the UC Davis DataLab, and will be broadcast as part of UC Love Data Week. An optional final 5th session will be offered entirely remotely for additional Q&A by all audiences.

How do structures of power and oppression shape the data we collect, analyses we perform, and research insights we develop? Together we will reflect on selected chapters from the (freely available) book Data Feminism by Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein. Come prepared to apply takeaways from the readings to unpacking provided case studies from the health sciences, and your own research processes. Researchers from all domains are welcome to participate. Together we’ll brainstorm how as individuals and a community we can contribute to more equitable data-driven research.",

        "description": "Virtual Reality (VR) has evolved from an expensive and finicky niche technology only available at well-funded large institutions, into a practical consumer product with tremendous research potential. While current-generation VR devices are primarily intended for the video gaming market, their use is not limited to gaming and has tremendous potential for researchers. The VR Research Initiative at UC Davis DataLab is translating visualization technology initially created for the UC Davis W.M. Keck Center for Active Visualization in the Earth Sciences (KeckCAVES), to function with modern commodity VR devices. By developing and supporting open-source software for gaming VR headsets, DataLab seeks to promote equitable access to emerging technologies and enable diverse communities of researchers and the public to explore 3D data. In this session, we will discuss the fundamental principles and reasons why VR is highly effective for the analysis of large and complex three-dimensional data. We will introduce several concrete VR applications based on those principles that are being developed at UC Davis DataLab, and will describe how participants can build their own VR systems, able to run DataLabs VR applications, at their own institutions. By the end of this session participants will be able to: describe how current-generation virtual reality (VR) technology such as VR headsets meant for gaming can effectively be used for scientific data analysis; discuss why VR is useful for analysis of data, specifically complex and large three-dimensional data; and identify where to go to learn more about setting up their own VR systems using the latest VR technologies for research.",

While laws determine the legal parameters governing data use, data science approaches that are technically legal can still be used unethically and irresponsibly, with disastrous consequences from loss of revenue to human rights violations. Through case studies and interactive sessions, this workshop provides an overview of how to practice responsible data science by incorporating considerations of ethics, equity, and justice. We will discuss FACT (fairness, accuracy, confidentiality, and transparency) based approaches to increasing the integrity of our work in data science. By the end of this workshop, learner should be able to: Describe examples of how the development of data science can both contribute to inequities and be leveraged to address them in their own domain. Begin to identify the underlying goals and incentives influencing their data-driven research. Assess whether a research project’s data meets FAIR criteria. Use a responsible data science framework to evaluate the potential impact(s) of a research project case study. Revise their research design using FACT principles.",

        "description": "Virtual Reality (VR) has evolved from an expensive and finicky niche technology only available at well-funded large institutions, into a practical consumer product with tremendous research potential. While current-generation VR devices are primarily intended for the video gaming market, their use is not limited to gaming and has tremendous potential for researchers. The VR Research Initiative at UC Davis DataLab is translating visualization technology initially created for the UC Davis W.M. Keck Center for Active Visualization in the Earth Sciences (KeckCAVES), to function with modern commodity VR devices. By developing and supporting open-source software for gaming VR headsets, DataLab seeks to promote equitable access to emerging technologies and enable diverse communities of researchers and the public to explore 3D data. In this session, we will discuss the fundamental principles and reasons why VR is highly effective for the analysis of large and complex three-dimensional data. We will introduce several concrete VR applications based on those principles that are being developed at UC Davis DataLab, and will describe how participants can build their own VR systems, able to run DataLabs VR applications, at their own institutions. By the end of this session participants will be able to: describe how current-generation virtual reality (VR) technology such as VR headsets meant for gaming can effectively be used for scientific data analysis; discuss why VR is useful for analysis of data, specifically complex and large three-dimensional data; and identify where to go to learn more about setting up their own VR systems using the latest VR technologies for research.",

Through case studies and interactive sessions, this workshop provides an overview of how to practice responsible data science by incorporating considerations of ethics, equity, and justice. We will discuss FACT (fairness, accuracy, confidentiality, and transparency) based approaches to increasing the integrity of our work in data science. By the end of this workshop, learner should be able to: Describe examples of how the development of data science can both contribute to inequities and be leveraged to address them in their own domain. Begin to identify the underlying goals and incentives influencing their data-driven research. Assess whether a research project’s data meets FAIR criteria. Use a responsible data science framework to evaluate the potential impact(s) of a research project case study. Revise their research design using FACT principles.",

From 10 - 11am, we'll cover how to add and edit Wikidata items.  From 11am until 1pm, you can choose your level of participation.  Dive into some hands-on solo editing or ask questions.  While you can bring your own data projects, we will have a project list, so everything you need to successfully edit or upload a Wikidata item will be provided during the session.  <br><br>No previous knowledge of Wikidata is necessary, but we highly recommend attending the Wikidata Basics workshop held on Monday, February 13, 2023.",
